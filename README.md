rsutils
=======

Simple utility and convenience functions such as vector math, coinflipping, and ffts in C used by roughsoft.

So far these are just portable niche functions that probably don't apply to many others.  As a caveat, there are certainly lots of other libs out there that do these things better and more efficiently.  That being said, I'm putting this up under the MIT license, so you can use it in your commercial projects without worry if there's something you want to use.
